# Welcome to The Core Dump!

Welcome to my blog! Here, you'll find a comprehensive documentation of my journey as a software developer. 
This blog serves as a living record of the projects I've implemented, the strategies I've devised, the roadblocks I've encountered, and the solutions 
I've discovered. You'll also find detailed explanations of key concepts and links to the repositories for each project. 
My aim is to keep this blog updated as I continue to grow and learn, making it a valuable resource for both myself and others in the developer community.

About me! My name is Guillermo Saez, I am software developer who graduated in 2023 from UNC Chapel Hill. I am passionate about programming and, 
like many other developers, I strive to learn and stay up to date with various technologies. However, I've made it a point to always keep track of 
what I do and take a step back to understand the intricacies of my work. I have a particular interest in understanding how things work, especially 
when it comes to libraries. I believe that building things myself provides a deeper understanding of the concepts, which I can apply moving forward.
