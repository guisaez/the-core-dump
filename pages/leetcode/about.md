## Leetcode Solutions / Analysis

I plan to use this as a refernece to my previously solved leetcode problems. The goal is not to have an optimal copy of the code, or what the expected solution should be but notes on my thinking process for each problem I try to solve. 

Ideally this will help me to identify patterns in my solutions.
